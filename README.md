# RECIPE-GENERATION-FROM-FOOD-IMAGES-USING-DEEP-LEARNING
Food photos are widely available online in the digital era, providing a fantastic chance to transform eating experiences. This research presents a unique method that uses convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to automatically synthesize recipes from food photographs.
## ABOUT
Our system sets off on a complex trip that includes component identification, amount estimate, and step-by-step cooking directions. The goal of this initiative is to close the gap between helpful culinary advice and enticing visual food inspiration.
## FEATURES
- Implements advance neural network method.
- A framework based application for deployment purpose.
- High scalability.
- Less time complexity.
## REQUIREMENTS
- Operating System: Requires a 64-bit OS (Windows 10 or Ubuntu) for compatibility with deep learning frameworks.
- Development Environment: Python 3.6
- Development Environment: Python 3.6
- IDE: Use of VSCode as the Integrated Development Environment for coding, debugging, and version control integration.
